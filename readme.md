# Golang Go routine

This Go program demonstrates a simple implementation of a worker pattern using goroutines and channels to process a queue of tasks. The program randomly generates a number of tasks (queue items), then processes each task asynchronously in a single worker. Each task simulates processing time by sleeping for a random duration between 1 and 3 seconds.
